Due to the low interest in ThunderSMP I have decided to stop serving the Minecraft server, I will upload the worlds of S6 and S7, and maybe more if people want it.

If there is demand for a guide on how to run your own Minecraft server on your own hardware I can make a guide for it, just send a message in the Discord.
