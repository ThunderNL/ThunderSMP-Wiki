# About the future of ThunderSMP S7

The server is currently using a whitelist system, this means that if a new player wants to join a staff member has to aprrove them, which could take up to a day.

This is why I potentially want to open the server for everyone. To make sure everyone's buildings and items are protected, I would want to install some sort of protection plugin, that would make it easy to claim pieces of land and maybe even share it with other people.

Two plugins that could be used are [RedProtect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/redprotect-anti-grief-server-protection-region-management-1-7-1-18.15841/) and [ProtectionStones](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protectionstones-updated-for-1-17.61797/), if you have a preference for one of the two please let me know on Discord (ThunderNL#2324), or [make a feature request](https://thundersmp.nl.eu.org/issues).
