# S9.1 has been released!

The plan is to make this the 'last' version of TSMP, while being updated to the lasted Minecraft: Java Edition version (1.19.4 as of now).

Some noteable changes from previous versions:

+ There is a new server map, visable at [map.tsmp.nl.eu.org](http://map.tsmp.nl.eu.org)
+ There is a new Discord bot, that allows for chat linking and account linking
  + You need the 'Whitelisted' role on Discord to join the server
+ Land Claiming has returned, with the [GriefPrevention Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefprevention.1884/)
+ FreedomChat, which disables chat reporting enforced by Microsoft

*Please note that the server isn't finalized yet, so some things may change.*

Have fun playing!
