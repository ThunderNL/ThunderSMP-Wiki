# Start Guide

This guide will teach you the basic extra's on the ThunderSMP *(e.g. homes, graves)*.

## Homes

Homes allow you to teleport to locations around the Minecraft world, you can set these locations for yourself (max. 5) and you can teleport to other players their homes.

### How to set homes

To set a home location, use the `/sethome <name>` command.

Note that if you leave the `<name>` blank, your home will simply be named `home`. 

### How to delete homes

To delete a home, you can simply use the `/delhome <name>` command.

Be careful, because you can't bring back deleted homes unless you go back to the location.

### How to teleport to homes

This is the command you will probably use most for homes, this command allows you to teleport to your set homes and you can teleport to other players their homes with the use of this command.

If you want to teleport to one of your own homes, you can simply use the `/home <name>` command, and you will be teleported to your named home.

Teleporting to another players home requires you to use the `/home [player:]<name>` command, please note that Bedrock player names have a `*` in front of them.

Using the home command on its own (like `/home`) will list all of your available homes.

`/h` does the same as `/home home`, so it will teleport you to your default home.

## Land Claiming

You can claim land using [GriefPrevention](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefprevention.1884/), watch [this video](https://youtu.be/VDsjXB-BaE0) to learn more. To buy more claim blocks use the `/buyclaimblocks` command.

## Earning Money

You earn money for being online and for killing mobs.

## Map

There is a map visable at [map.tsmp.nl.eu.org](http://map.tsmp.nl.eu.org/)

## Graves

If you die, a grave will appear on your death loaction containing all of your stuff, so you don't have to worry about your stuff despawning or that someone else steals it.

To see all of your current graves use the `/graves` command, then a GUI will pop up displaying all of your current graves, you can then select a grave to teleport to using the GUI.
